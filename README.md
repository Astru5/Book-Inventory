<h2 id="Challenges">Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>Personally, I was not too familiar with UI/front-end development, so CSS was a bit of a challenge, but it wasn't too hard to learn</li>
<li>When it came to exporting, it took a lot longer than I had hoped to get the application to export correctly. It kept exporting as an html file, but I was eventually able to fix it</li>
